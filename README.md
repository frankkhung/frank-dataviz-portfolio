Dive in to explore my data-driven projects and exploration. For a detailed look at my professional journey, you'll find my resume in the navigation bar (Currently work in progress!). Enjoy your visit!

# About me
I am a dedicated professional with a passion for project-based work and a strong foundation in statistics and data science. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University. My past experience includes working as a Data Analyst at Intuit Inc. and Deloitte, where I leveraged my analytical acumen to guide clients through complex risk landscapes. Beyond my professional life, I am an avid photographer, an endeavor that allows me to capture and appreciate the world's intricacies. Balancing these numerical and visual perspectives, I bring a unique, data-driven viewpoint to all that I do.

# What I hope to learn

My goal in this course is to master the art of data storytelling, especially learning how to translate complex findings into clear and compelling narratives that resonate with any audience and stakeholders. This includes honing my technical skills in data visualization to create graphics that are not only accurate but also visually engaging. Ultimately, I plan to apply these skills by building a comprehensive portfolio of data analysis projects on GitHub that showcases my ability to tell a complete story with data, from initial question to final insight.
