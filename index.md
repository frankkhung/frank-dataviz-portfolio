# Frank's Data Visualization Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! Here's where all my cool work will go.

## About me
Hi! I really like data. And I like visualizations. So I guess you can say that I like data visualizations!

## What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things. If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

1. List item #1
2. List item #2
3. List item #3

or...

- List item #1
- List item #2
- List item #3
